<h1 align="center">Homework 2: Fragments</h1>
<h2 align="center">Points: 10</h2>
<h2 align="center">Deadline: 10 October, 2022 11:59PM</h2>

Before working on this or any assignment, you will need to set up the **Android Studio IDE** on your computer. You will create an Android project with the name **HW2_YOURNAME_YOURPARTNERNAME** by selecting **Kotlin** as the language. We suggest that you do this as early as possible, because some students may get stuck and need time to get the IDE set up. 

<h4>Assignment Description:</h4>

For this second assignment, we'll practice whatever topics we covered in the class. You should develop an app that has the following: 
1. Your app should be set up as an **Android Studio project**, so it can easily be opened/graded by others. 
2. Create two buttons named Bar and Line in MainActivity. Then create one Fragment. Your app will display a Line graph by default into the Fragment. Based on the button click, it will display either a Line graph and Bar graph. You have to dynamically load either one of the graphs. Please use the below data to produce your graphs. Here, a, b, c are series, and 1, 2, 3, 4 are domain labels. For drawing the graph, you can use the following library:  [https://github.com/halfhp/androidplot](https://github.com/halfhp/androidplot)

</p>

:stop_sign:**```Please don’t load images of Bar and Line, rather draw graphs based on sample data.```**


If you want help, please feel free to show your code to others or ask for help in our online discussion forum. Feel free to make an app as simple or as complex as you like, relative to your familiarity level and time constraints. If you work on your solution for a few hours and are still not done, you can turn it in, and we will award you credit. You can do it! 
 
<h4>For uploading the project, you have to follow two steps:</h4>

1. Create a folder name called **“Output”** inside the project folder. Make a small video showing your program functionality in the emulator and show your code as well. 1~2 minutes video is fine. 
2. Push your code with video in Github.
Your submission will be graded by watching the video or simply running the code and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive credit. Your code will not be graded on style, but we still encourage you to follow a good overall coding style for your own sake. 

If you have any confusion, please raise this issue before the class. I will try to clarify as much as possible. 

<h5>Grading Rubrics:</h5>
